# ChatPDF Clone - Project Goals & Progress Tracker

## üìã Project Overview
Develop a question-answering system similar to [chatPDF](https://www.chatpdf.com/) that can answer questions about AI research papers using the Gemini API.

## üéØ Core Objectives

### Primary Features
- [ ] **Direct Query Processing**: Answer questions that can be matched directly to text in paragraphs
- [ ] **Indirect Query Processing**: Handle questions without specific keywords in the text
- [ ] **Key Reference Identification**: Identify references that inspire the proposed methodology
- [ ] **Command-Line Interface**: Simple CLI for user interaction
- [ ] **Token Optimization**: Limit context to ~800 tokens to minimize API costs

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] **PDF Processing**: Extract and process text from research papers
- [ ] **Text Chunking**: Intelligently split content for API processing
- [ ] **API Integration**: Use Gemini API (key: AIzaSyDhu_53or7bktMHSOeO39zY40NNebvDKmA)
- [ ] **Context Management**: Optimize token usage before API calls
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for API and file operations

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components

### Core Modules
- [x] **main.py**: Entry point and application orchestration
- [x] **pdf_processor.py**: PDF text extraction and preprocessing
- [x] **ai_handler.py**: Gemini API integration and query processing
- [x] **cli.py**: Command-line interface implementation
- [x] **text_chunker.py**: Intelligent text segmentation for token optimization (integrated in pdf_processor.py)
- [x] **config.py**: Configuration management (API keys, settings)

### Dependencies
- [ ] **PyPDF2 or pdfplumber**: PDF text extraction
- [ ] **google-generativeai**: Gemini API client
- [ ] **click or argparse**: CLI framework
- [ ] **tiktoken**: Token counting for optimization
- [ ] **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management

## üìö Testing Requirements

### Test Files Available
- `bert_research_paper.pdf` (16 pages)
- `ai_application_research_paper.pdf`
- `ml_in_ai_research_paper.pdf`

### BERT Paper Test Questions
- [x] **Direct Queries**:
  - [x] "What kind of neural network architecture is used in this paper?"
  - [x] "What datasets have been used for evaluation?"

- [x] **Indirect Queries**:
  - [x] "What are the main discoveries of this paper?"
  - [x] "What is the key insight of the proposed method?"

### Additional Test Cases
- [ ] **AI Application Paper**: Create and test appropriate questions
- [ ] **ML in AI Paper**: Create and test appropriate questions
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Test with malformed queries, empty PDFs, etc.

- [x] Query type classification (direct, indirect, references)

### In Progress üîÑ
- [ ] Testing with remaining PDF files (AI application, ML in AI papers)
- [ ] Performance optimization and refinements

### Blocked/Issues üö´
*None currently*

## üîß Technical Decisions

### API Choice
- **Selected**: Gemini API (provided key)
- **Reason**: Cost-effective alternative to OpenAI GPT
- **Token Limit**: ~800 tokens per request for cost optimization

### PDF Processing
- **Strategy**: Extract full text, then chunk intelligently
- **Considerations**: Preserve context while staying within token limits

### Text Chunking Strategy
- **Approach**: Semantic chunking with overlap
- **Goal**: Maintain context while optimizing for API limits

## üìù Notes & Considerations

### Cost Optimization
- Pre-process and filter content before API calls
- Use semantic search to find relevant chunks
- Implement caching for repeated queries

### Quality Assurance
- Test with all three provided research papers
- Validate answers against paper content
- Ensure different query types work correctly

### Future Enhancements
- Web interface option
- Multiple file support
- Query history and caching
- Advanced semantic search
